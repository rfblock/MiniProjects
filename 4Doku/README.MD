# 4DOKU
This is a version of Sudoku that has been extended to four dimensions
This game has a base of 2, which makes it a 4x4x4x4 board.
The list of numbers range from 0-F, which can be inputed by selecting a cell and pressing the corrosponding key on the keyboard.
The cursor can be moved with arrow keys, and will highlight which sells that are in the same 4-cell, row, column, tube, or mode-4 slice.

### WIP
This is still currenty in progress, the game may or may not be in a functional state, and is prone to many changes in the future.
